Coding from scratch - Javascript slideshow

Stack all images on top of each other using CSS, and hide every image except the first.
In slideshow.js, create a current variable starting at 0 and a total variable set to 4.

Add a click event to the next button that logs “next”, increments current, resets it to 0 when it exceeds 3, hides all images, and shows the one matching current.

Repeat the same logic for the previous button.
